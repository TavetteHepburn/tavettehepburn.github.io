Hi there, thanks for stopping by! I'm Tavette, a girl from the islands who was always intrigued by computers. Not in a "have to have the latest tech" kind of way but a "I wonder what will happen if..." kind of way. I have always been curious... curious but afraid to tinker because I might break something.

My family got our first computer in 2001, I was in the 7th grade and my sister won it for placing 1st in the beauty pageant hosted by her high school. I was a misunderstood kid who felt like nobody really knew me. I used that computer to explore a world I thought I'd never get to see in real life.

Today, over two decades later, I find myself on a journey to do the things I longed to as a kid but couldn't. I want to finally tinker and find out how a computer really works. I want to finally break things without fear - and then fix them, of course. I want to learn and teach others along the way if anyone finds this stuff useful. This blog is my little slice of the internet pie to share any and everything. It may be a bit messy, posts may be unrelated, but you're welcome to poke around.

Eat up!

- Tavette
