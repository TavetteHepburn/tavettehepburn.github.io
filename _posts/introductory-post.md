## Welcome

Hi there, thanks for stopping by! I'm Tavette, a technology professional living in The Bahamas. My goal for this blog is to share my knowledge as I learn and become proficient in different technologies. I have worked as IT Support in the hospitality industry and currently transitioning into the Healthcare industry.

## My Introduction to Computers
My love for computers began in 2001 when my family got our first computer. I was in the 7th grade and my sister won it for placing 1st in the beauty pageant hosted by her high school. As a young girl from the islands, I used that computer to explore a world I thought I'd never get to see in real life. One of the challenges I faced back then was fear to break such a prized possession so I never fully explored that machine the way I had the desire to, there was too much at stake. That early experience sparked a curiosity that never left me, even if I didnâ€™t have the chance to fully explore it then.

## Present Day
Today, over two decades later, I am a Computer Science student in University. I find myself finally ready to dive in and understand how a computer really works. Studying Computer Science has not been easy and I realize now that there are many technical topics that are presented in a way that is hard to grasp when you do not have a technical background. My goal is to break down the topics that I find have been the most difficult to grasp as well as create and share projects that show how these technologies are applicable in the real world. You can expect posts about computer hardware, networking, programming, software engineering and database systems.

I welcome connections from those in the IT industry, especially in Cloud and DevOps. You can connect with me on X or LinkedIn.

Thanks, Tavette.
